  <h1>Who I Am And How I Got Here</h1>
  <p>I like to thing of my self as a very responsible person and also very thorough with details (I gusess it's both a strength and a weakness)</p>
  <p>My career path was pretty straight up untill the university, I was studying mecatronics and it was there were my interst in programing grew (I always had an intrest but at that time and because of where I came from I never really saw it like something I could engage fully as a career)</p>
